Imitates [the original Sound of Sorting](http://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/)
in your browser. Started for interest, finished for the OOD course.

Try it [here](https://chrisoft.org/sound-of-sorting/).

The code uses lots of ES2015 features plus `async/await`. However babel should
be able to handle it.

As I am actually a Javascript (and node.js) hater but couldn't resist the
convience it provides, the code is like a huge pile of hybrid biohazardous substance.

As it has been finished already, this repo is very likely to be a upload-and-forget
one.
